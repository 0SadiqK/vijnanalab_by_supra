          theory: "The Vernier Caliper is a high-precision measuring instrument invented by Pierre Vernier in 1631. It uses a differential scale arrangement to measure dimensions with greater accuracy than a standard meter scale.\n\n**Working Principle (Vernier Acuity):**\nThe device relies on the ability of the human eye to detect the alignment of lines (Vernier Acuity) much more precisely than it can estimate position between lines. It consists of two scales:\n1. **Main Scale:** Fixed, graduated in millimeters.\n2. **Vernier Scale:** Sliding, usually having 10 divisions that span 9mm of the main scale.\n\n**Least Count (L.C.):**\nThe Least Count is the smallest difference between a Main Scale Division (MSD) and a Vernier Scale Division (VSD).\nL.C. = 1 MSD - 1 VSD\nIf N vernier divisions coincide with (N-1) main scale divisions:\n1 VSD = ((N-1)/N) MSD\nTherefore, L.C. = 1 MSD - ((N-1)/N) MSD = (1/N) MSD.\nFor a standard caliper: 1 MSD = 1mm, N = 10. Thus, L.C. = 0.1mm or 0.01cm.\n\n**Measurement Formula:**\nTotal Reading = Main Scale Reading (MSR) + (Vernier Coincidence (VC) × L.C.)\n- **MSR:** The main scale mark immediately to the left of the vernier zero.\n- **VC:** The division on the vernier scale that aligns perfectly with any main scale mark.\n\n**Zero Error Correction:**\nIdeally, when jaws are closed, the zeros of both scales coincide. If not, there is a Zero Error:\n- **Positive Error:** Vernier zero is to the right. Correction is negative.\n- **Negative Error:** Vernier zero is to the left. Correction is positive.",

The restoring force is the tangential component of gravity:\nF_restoring = -mg sinθ\nFor small angles, sinθ ≈ θ (radians). Since θ = x/L (arc/radius):\nF = -mg(x/L) = -(mg/L)x\nThis form F = -kx confirms SHM with force constant k = mg/L.\n\n**Time Period Derivation:**\nThe time period T for SHM is given by T = 2π√(m/k).\nSubstituting k = mg/L:\nT = 2π√(m / (mg/L)) = 2π√(L/g)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- **Length (L):** Distance from the point of suspension to the center of gravity of the bob.\n- **Acceleration due to Gravity (g):** Varies with altitude and latitude. Standard value is 9.8 m/s².\n- **Isochronism:** The period is independent of amplitude for small swings.\n\n**Graph Analysis:**\nA plot of L vs T² yields a straight line passing through the origin.

It functions in the pH range 8.2–10.0.\n- In Acid (HCl): Colorless\n- In Base (Excess NaOH): Pink\n\n**Molarity Equation:**\nUsing the law of equivalence: M₁V₁/n₁ = M₂V₂/n₂\nFor HCl and NaOH, stoichiometry is 1:1, so:\nM(acid) × V(acid) = M(base) × V(base)",
